While most UI elements are scalable by default, the Map icons and ther labels (the orbit apoapsis for example) are not, that makes the game almost unplayable at high resolutions. This Mod scales those things using the stock UI Scale setting.

This add on is still in early development so some things might appear offset or incorrectly scaled. It's also my first add on for KSP, so please feel free to leave feedback or <a href="https://git.srv.hoerberg.de/tom300z/4ksp/issues">report an issue</a> so i can improve it.

I needed to have an alternate size from the stock UI_SCALE, so I've taken this and expanded it by adding a window to dynamically scale the map icons and text.

There is a new button when in flight scene: https://i.imgur.com/ORofiqJ.png

Clicking it will open the following window in which you can adjust the sizes while on the map screen.:
